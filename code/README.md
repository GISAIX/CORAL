The files (protofiles and logs) of the Deep CORAL Office31 experiment can be found in D-CORAL_Office31.zip. Sample protofile for shift A->W is provided. For other shifts, one can change the protofile accordingly based on the weight of CORAL loss in the log files. Please make sure that the ''batch_size'' in the trainval prototxt and ''test_iter'' in the solver prototxt for TEST phase match the size of the TARGET dataset (i.e., please refer to line 76 in a_w_trainval_coral_fc8_loss_0.8_full_source.prototxt and line 2 in a_w_solver_coral_fc8_loss_0.8_full_source.prototxt for an concrete example).
